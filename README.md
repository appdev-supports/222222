Points Calculation:
In Baccarat, Ace's poker is counted as 1 point; poker cards from 2 to 9 are calculated by the points they display; 10, J, Q and K are counted Zero (some degrees to 10 points). When the sum of the points of all the cards exceeds 9, only the ones in the total number are counted. Therefore, a card size of 8 and a 9 is: 7 (8 + 9 = 17). Since only a single number of poker cards is counted, the maximum possible number of points is 9 (eg, a 4 and a 5: 4 + 5 = 9) and a minimum of 0, also known as baccarat (eg, a 10 And a Q: 10 + 10 = 20, only the ones digit is 0).
